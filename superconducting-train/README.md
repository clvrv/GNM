A superconductor is frozen with liquid nitrogen in the magnetic field of systematically arranged neodymium magnets that form a track. The arrangement of the neodymium magnets allows the superconductor to travel along the track. And this - with the exception of air resistance - without friction.

## Schematics

### Parts List 

**1. Superconducting Track:**
* Neodymium Magnets N42 (40 x 10 x 5 mm; 20 x 10 x 5 mm; 10 x 10 x 5 mm)
* 2x superconductors, [[purchased here.](https://www.educentral.de/p/supraleiter-ybacuo-scheibe-25-mm-x-9-mm)]
  * Material: YBaCuO (yttrium-barium-copper oxide)
  * Transition temperature: -180 °C
  * Diameter: 25 mm
  * Height: 9 mm
 * Liquid Nitrogen
* 1x Screen-printed panel
* 1x Magnetic sheet metal

**_SAFETY WARNING!_** This experiment uses **extremely strong neodymium magnets.** These magnets, if not handled
carefully, can cause serious injury. Keep the magnets away from magnetic materials and far from sensitive electronics.

**_HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS_** The **superconductor** is sensitive to moisture. If not handled properly it will lose its superconducting properties. You should always let the
levitator warm up and dry after usage. We recommend that you store the levitator in dry atmosphere, preferably inside a sealed container with silica gel.

### Setup

To maintain the superconducting state, YBCO is cooled using liquid nitrogen, which keeps the temperature extremely low, often below 77 K (-196°C).

### Troubleshooting

## Scientific Background

### Superconductivity

Superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon of zero electrical resistance. It was discovered in 1911 by a dutch physicist named Kamerlingh Onnes. Superconductivity occurs only below a certain critical temperature (T_c). Metals such as aluminum, lead, tin become superconductors only at temperatures close to the absolute zero (-273.15°C). In 1986 a new family of superconductors was discovered having a much higher T_c, close and even higher than the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen (-196.15°C).

### Meissner Effect
The expulsion of magnetic field from a superconductor is an intrinsic property of any superconductor.
Below a certain magnetic field the superconductor expels nearly all the magnetic flux. It does that by driving currents near its surface. These currents produce a magnetic field within the bulk that cancels the external field.

### Flux Pinning
In some cases the magnetic flux becomes locked or “pinned” inside a superconductor. Flux pinning is desirable in high - temperature ceramic superconductors to prevent flux movements which introduce a resistance and dissipates energy. The pinning is achieved through defects in the crystalline structure of the superconductor usually resulting from grain boundaries or impurities.
