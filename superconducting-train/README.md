## Setup

### Parts List 

Superconducting Track: 
* Neodym Magnets N42 (40 x 10 x 5 mm; 20 x 10 x 5 mm; 10 x 10 x 5 mm)
* 2x yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) superconductors
* Liquid Nitrogen
* 1x Screen-printed panel
* 1x Magnetic sheet metal

Live Camera Projection:
* Camera
* Mini-HDMI to HDMI cable
* 1x Tripod
* 1x Projector

### How it works

To maintain the superconducting state, YBCO is cooled using liquid nitrogen, which keeps the temperature extremely low, often below 77 K (-196°C).
