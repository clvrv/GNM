A superconductor is frozen with liquid nitrogen in the magnetic field of systematically arranged neodymium magnets that form a track. The arrangement of the neodymium magnets allows the superconductor to travel along the track. And this - with the exception of air resistance - without friction.

## Schematics

### Parts List 

**1. Superconducting Track:**
* Neodymium Magnets N42 (40 x 10 x 5 mm; 20 x 10 x 5 mm; 10 x 10 x 5 mm)
* 2x superconductors, [[purchased here.](https://www.educentral.de/p/supraleiter-ybacuo-scheibe-25-mm-x-9-mm)]
  * Material: YBaCuO (yttrium-barium-copper oxide)
  * Transition temperature: -180 °C
  * Diameter: 25 mm
  * Height: 9 mm
* Liquid Nitrogen
* 1x Screen-printed panel
* 1x Magnetic sheet metal
* Dewar flask - A container for transporting and storing liquid nitrogen
* 1x large ladle
* 2x small ladles for cooling the superconductor
* Safety gloves

**_SAFETY WARNING!_** This experiment uses **extremely strong neodymium magnets.** These magnets, if not handled carefully, can cause serious injury. Keep the magnets away from magnetic materials and far from sensitive electronics.

**_HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS_** The **superconductor** is sensitive to moisture. If not handled properly it will lose its superconducting properties. You should always let the
levitator warm up and dry after usage. We recommend that you store the levitator in dry atmosphere, preferably inside a sealed container with silica gel.

### Construction of the maglev train

1. Cut a rectangular wood panel as a base of the maglev train.

2. Cut the magnetic sheet metal into a rectangle; as well as four stripes.

3. Drill four holes into each corner of the metal rectangle, as well as in each side of the stripes. Then countersink a screw with a countersunk head drill.
4. Screw the four metal strips to the wood using flat-head screws.
5.  Laser-cut the shape of the magnetic track out of wood. Use this as a template to create the track with the magnets. _The file for the laser cutter is attached._

6. Since the sheet is magnetic, neodymium magnets will adhere to it. These magnets are arranged in groups of three, oriented as either North-South-North or South-North-South. They should be aligned consistently along the curve. In the inner circle, all magnets are oriented with their south poles facing inward. In the middle circle, the magnets face north, and in the outer circle, they face south again.

**_SAFETY WARNING!_** This experiment uses **extremely strong neodymium magnets.** These magnets, if not handled carefully, can cause serious injury, such as pinching fingers. Use gloves!
    
7. Due to the strength of the magnets, the rectangular sheet will adhere securely to the four stripes screwed to the wooden panel. To align the metal sheet with the panel, use spacers to adjust and align each side of the rectangle sequentially. **_Be careful during this process; the spacers are also used to prevent finger pinching._**
8. Screw the metal sheet with the neodymium magnets to the wood panel.

_The idea behind this type of assemblage, is the possibility to change every single element. You could even change the form of the track if wanted!_
 
9. Place a Styrofoam plate and a light wooden plate on the magnetic track to secure it for transport and storage.

### Setup

1. Place the semiconductor in a small ladle on the track.
2. Fill the ladle with liquid nitrogen. To induce the superconducting state, cool the YBCO using liquid nitrogen, which maintains a temperature below 77 K (-196°C).

3. When the liquid nitrogen stops boiling, transfer the remaining liquid into a Dewar flask.
4. Using safety gloves, place the superconductor on the track — it should now levitate.
5. In order to increase the levitating time, you can wrap the YBCO-bulks in absorbent paper and then attached them with ROXOLID Alu Tape (adhesive tape).

## Scientific Background

### Superconductivity

Superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon of zero electrical resistance. It was discovered in 1911 by a dutch physicist named Kamerlingh Onnes. Superconductivity occurs only below a certain critical temperature (T_c). Metals such as aluminum, lead, tin become superconductors only at temperatures close to the absolute zero (-273.15°C). In 1986 a new family of superconductors was discovered having a much higher T_c, close and even higher than the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen (-196.15°C).

### Meissner Effect
The expulsion of magnetic field from a superconductor is an intrinsic property of any superconductor.
Below a certain magnetic field the superconductor expels nearly all the magnetic flux. It does that by driving currents near its surface. These currents produce a magnetic field within the bulk that cancels the external field.

### Flux Pinning
In some cases the magnetic flux becomes locked or “pinned” inside a superconductor. Flux pinning is desirable in high - temperature ceramic superconductors to prevent flux movements which introduce a resistance and dissipates energy. The pinning is achieved through defects in the crystalline structure of the superconductor usually resulting from grain boundaries or impurities.
