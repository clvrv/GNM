Since 2023, the AG New Materials presents parts of its work during The Long Night of Science (Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften).
 
The exhibition focus on communicating a phenomenon that has many applications today: superconductivity.
 
Under the title "Let it levitate! - Physics for medical technology, energy supply and quantum computing", a superconducting magnetic levitation train will be presented, filmed live and projected on the wall. In addition, the group will provide information explaining the fundamentals and current applications of superconductivity. PhD students from the group will also be on site to answer questions from visitors.
 
The group is currently researching superconductivity in ferecrystals. Superconductors have the property of conducting electricity without resistance above a certain transition temperature. This property causes the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect. This effect allows the superconductor to lock into any magnetic field without contact. The magnetic levitation train makes use of this property. You can find out exactly how it does this during the Long Night of Science.
