Since 2023, the AG Novel Materials presents parts of its work during The Long Night of Science (Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften).
 
The exhibition focus on communicating a phenomenon that has many applications today: superconductivity.
 
Under the title "Let it levitate! - Physics for medical technology, energy supply and quantum computing", a superconducting magnetic levitation train will be presented, filmed live and projected on the wall. In addition, the group will provide information explaining the fundamentals and current applications of superconductivity. PhD students from the group will also be on site to answer questions from visitors.
 
The group is currently researching superconductivity in ferecrystals. Superconductors have the property of conducting electricity without resistance above a certain transition temperature. This property causes the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect. This effect allows the superconductor to lock into any magnetic field without contact. The magnetic levitation train makes use of this property. You can find out exactly how it does this during the Long Night of Science.

### General Setup 

The cyanotype prints are attached to the whiteboard near the entrance using magnets, with descriptions of what is shown below.

</p>

The posters are also attached with magnets to the two pillars directly opposite the first door. Between the two pillars, the chairs that were previously in the room and not being used will be stacked.

Three lights, set to produce blue light, are placed along the room. See photos:

### Setup Superconducting Train
Two tables are placed at the height of the third column, centered in the room, and covered with light blue velvet. The velvet may need to be secured to the table with tape to prevent slipping. **_Caution: Do not block the emergency exit doors to the courtyard or the two doors leading to the hallway. These are escape routes!_**

On the tables, the large magnetic levitation track is placed with the plexiglass sheet in front of it, facing the audience. In front of the table, a red and white chain is set up to keep the audience at a safe distance from the liquid nitrogen, camera, and cables. On the chain you can tie the balloons filled with helium. 

Right next to the window, behind the third column, is a table for the scientists to prepare the experiment. There you will find the necessary safety items, as well as the liquid nitrogen and other materials such as the superconductor or the ladlers.

</div>

Behind the large track, the small superconducting magnetic track is placed along with its padded box. Superconductors are very brittle and expensive, and if they fall on the table or floor, they could break. Therefore, when using the small track, it should always be done over the padded box.

_**Due to the use of liquid nitrogen, windows and doors must remain open at all times during the LNDW!**_

### Setup Acoustic Levitator

For the Acoustic Levitator, two semicircular tables are brought into the room, placed in front of the yellow chairs, and covered with the dark blue velvet. The Acoustic Levitator is placed on the table and connected via a USBc cable to a power supply connected to an extension cord. Inside the Levitator is a pair of tweezers and a small piece of Styrofoam.
